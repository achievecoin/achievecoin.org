## Welcome to AchieveCoin.org

This is a community supported organzation for the development of AchieveCoin. The goal is to continue the innovations of cryptocurrency for the benefit of all humankind. 

Visions:
- Make cryptocurrency decentralized by using Equalhash and starting the blockchain from 0.
- Invent a true public domain Radial Code Standard as alternative to QR Code or Barcode.
- Develop scrip/gift card products to make AchieveCoin and other cryptocurrencies accessible on existing retail distribution networks around the world.



### What is AchieveCoin ‚®∫ 

AchieveCoin is an open-source cryptocurrency. Just like Bitcoin, there is no central authority to issue or regulate AchieveCoin. AchieveCoin further the decentralize character by using memory-intensive mining process. AchieveCoin's blockchain starts from number zero, which makes mining possible again for individuals, just like Bitcoin ten years ago.


### What is Radial Code ‚ùÑ

Each cryptocurrency address is a long unique string of numers and letters between 27 and 34 characters. [QR Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code) represents the address in machine-readable manner at point-of-sale systems. A [sudivision](http://www.qrcode.com/en/patent.html) of Toyota company created QR Code in 1994, which also holds number of patents for QR code.   

A better and fully public domain owned code which supports more data could open new doors for adoption of the currency and other technologies.

Analogy:
Traditional AM radio signal carries information in the amplitude, FM radio in frequency. What if we encode the information in polarization direction, it could contain multitude amount of data in the same 3D space. Nature already figured it out. For example, snowflake [no two alike](http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/entry/no-two-snowflakes-alike-video_n_4569491).

### Doing business with or without smartphone üí≥

Many places in the world have yet enter the mobile-age. Scrip products, like gift cards, would offer faster, trust, more reliable, at lower cost for many commercial transaction scenarios. AchieveCoin.org will develop scrip products for decentralized and fiat currencies.
