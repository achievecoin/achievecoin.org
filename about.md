This is a community supported project. The goal is to continue the innovations of cryptocurrency for the benefit of all humankind. 

ToDo list:
- Make cryptocurrency decentralized by using Equalhash and starting the blockchain from 0. Just like Bitcoin ten years ago, and better.
- Invent a true public domain Radial Code Standard as alternative to QR Code or Barcode.
- Develop scrip/gift card products to make AchieveCoin and other cryptocurrencies accessible on retail distribution networks around the world.

## Dream, Build, Achieve
