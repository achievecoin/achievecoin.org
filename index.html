        <h2>Welcome to AchieveCoin.org</h2>
        <p class="lead">
          This is a community supported organization for the development of AchieveCoin. The goal is to solve three big problems, detailed below, as quickly as possible. Our spirit is to continue the innovations of cryptocurrency for the benefit of all humanity.
        </p>

        <h4>Visions</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Make cryptocurrency decentralized by using Equihash and starting the blockchain from 0</li>
          <li>Invent a true public domain Radial Code Standard as alternative to QR Code and Barcode</li>
          <li>Develop scrip/gift card products to make AchieveCoin and other cryptocurrencies easier to access on existing retail distribution networks around the world</li>

        <h2>1. What is AchieveCoin ‚®∫</h2>
        <p>Fairness in trading requires a truly decentralized currency. AchieveCoin, currency symbol ‚®∫, trading symbol ACH, is an open-source cryptocurrency derived from Bitcoin Gold. Just like Bitcoin, there is no central authority to issue or regulate AchieveCoin. AchieveCoin further the decentralize characteristic by using memory-intensive mining process. AchieveCoin‚Äôs blockchain starts from number zero, which makes mining possible again for individuals, just like Bitcoin ten years ago.

        <h2>2. What is Radial Code ‚ùÑ</h2>

        <p>Both QRCode and Barcode are patented and owned by private entities . Each cryptocurrency address is a long unique string of numbers and letters between 27 and 34 characters. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code">QR Code</a> represents the address in machine-readable manner at point-of-sale systems. A <a href="http://www.qrcode.com/en/patent.html">subdivision</a> of Toyota company created QR Code in 1994, who holds number of patents for QR code.

          A better and fully public domain owned code which supports more data could open new doors for adoption of the currency and other technologies.

          Analogy:
          Traditional AM radio signal carries information in the amplitude, FM radio in frequency. What if we encode the information in polarization direction, it could contain multitude amount of data in the same 3D space. Nature has already figured it out. For example, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOfkukhb1Os">no two snowflakes are alike</a>. Tiny "snowflakes" are more than enough to hold all cryptocurrency addresses in the world.

        <h2>3. Doing business with or without smartphone üí≥</h2>

        <p>
          Many places in the world have yet entered the mobile-age. Scrip products, like gift cards, would offer faster, trust, more reliable, at lower cost for many commercial transaction scenarios. AchieveCoin.org will develop scrip products for decentralized cryptocurrency and fiat currencies.
